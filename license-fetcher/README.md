## Aspirations

1. Fetch licenses!
2. Fast!
3. Do it in the build step!


## Workings

Crates that are compiled with your program are fetched via `cargo metadata`.
License texts are read from the `.cargo/registry/src` folder.
The data is then serialized and compressed.


## Usage

### Include Dependency

> [!WARNING]
> Include this library as build dependency and as normal dependeny!

```
cargo add --build --features build license-fetcher
cargo add license-fetcher
```

### Build Script

This library requires you to execute it for fetching licenses in a build script.
Creat a file called `build.rs` in the root of your project and add following contents:
```rust
use license_fetcher::build_script::generate_package_list_with_licenses;

fn main() {
    generate_package_list_with_licenses().write();
    println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=build.rs");
    println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=Cargo.lock");
    println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=Cargo.toml");
}
```

### Main

Add following content to your `main.rs`:
```rust
use license_fetcher::get_package_list_macro;

fn main() {
    let packages = get_package_list_macro!().unwrap();
    println!("{}", packages);
}
```


## Alternatives

### [`license-retriever`](https://github.com/MRT-Map/license-retriever)

#### Pros
+ Also retrieves licenses in the build step and loads them into the program.

#### Cons
- Does not fetch licenses from local source files.
- Very slow.
- Does not compress licenses.


### [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about)

#### Pros
+ Generates very nice html.

#### Cons
- Is not a library to access said data but rather a command line tool.
- Does not fetch licenses from local source files.
